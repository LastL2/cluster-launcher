====================

Terraform scripts to deploy a Kubernetes cluster for THORNode.

Once you have a Kubernetes cluster up and running, please refer to the
documentation here to get started on how to start the THORNode itself:

Terraform is type of domain specific language (DSL) used to describe through
code infrastructure. It designed to make it easier to create/destroy
infrastructure hosted locally or by a provider such as AWS or Digital Ocean.

In choosing a provider, you will find at the root of this repository, a
directory with your provider name. If you do not see it, create it and open a
pull request so that others in the community can benefit from your work.

For more information or how to install the terraform CLI, goto [https://www.terraform.io/](https://www.terraform.io/).
