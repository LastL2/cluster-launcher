Terraform Scripts for deploying a THORNode

Terraform is type of domain specific language (DSL) used to describe through
code infrastructure. It designed to make it easier to create/destroy
infrastructure hosted locally or by a provider such as AWS or Digital Ocean.

In choosing a provider, you will find at the root of this repository, a
directory with your provider name. If you do not see it, create it and open a
pull request so that others in the community can benefit from your work.
